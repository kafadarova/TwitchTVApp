User stories 

The user can see whether the Free Code Camp channel is currently streaming on Twitch TV. If so it will display some details on what they are streaming. CLicking on it the user will be sent to the Twitch TV page of that streaming chanel. 

I created an array with the accounts. The API was used first to display the streams and second for the users. Using For each loop I could check each object and generate the proper html.
